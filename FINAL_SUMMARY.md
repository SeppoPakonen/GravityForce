# Gravity Strike - Allegro 4 to Allegro 5 Migration - Final Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete migration of Gravity Strike from Allegro 4 to Allegro 5 compatibility.

## Work Completed

### Commits Made
1. **Commit 23aae18**: "Migrate from Allegro 4 to Allegro 5 compatibility - Part 1"
   - Fixed major Allegro 4 compatibility issues:
     - Added Allegro 4 primitive drawing functions (line, circle, ellipse, etc.)
     - Fixed text handling functions for Allegro 5 compatibility
     - Resolved tolua function declarations and API issues
     - Fixed timer function conflicts
     - Added missing Allegro 4 constants and macros
     - Updated file I/O functions for Allegro 5 compatibility
   - Build progress: 27/30+ files now compiling successfully
   - Remaining issues isolated to networking code (RakNet library compatibility)

2. **Commit 9a41833**: "Migrate from Allegro 4 to Allegro 5 compatibility - Part 2"
   - Additional fixes for Allegro 4 compatibility:
     - Fixed gshelper.cpp exists function replacement
     - Fixed gshiscor.cpp function signature mismatch

### Major Components Fixed

#### Allegro Wrapper Enhancements
- Extended `allegro5_wrapper.h` and `allegro5_wrapper.cpp` with comprehensive Allegro 4 compatibility functions
- Added primitive drawing functions: line, circle, ellipse, ellipsefill, floodfill, rectfill, etc.
- Added text functions: aatextout, aatextout_right, textout_centre, etc.
- Added keyboard constants mapping (KB_*, KEY_*)
- Added file I/O compatibility functions

#### Lua/Tolua Integration
- Fixed tolua function declarations and signatures
- Added missing tolua functions (tolua_isboolean, tolua_pushusertype, etc.)
- Resolved tolua API compatibility issues

#### Function Compatibility Layer
- Replaced deprecated Allegro 4 functions with Allegro 5 equivalents
- Added stub implementations for functions that don't have direct Allegro 5 equivalents
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing Gravity Strike codebase

## Current Status
- **Build Success**: 27+ out of 30+ source files compiling successfully
- **Migration Progress**: ~90% complete
- **Remaining Issues**: Isolated to networking code (RakNet library compatibility)

## Next Steps
To complete the full migration:
1. Update RakNet library integration for modern compatibility
2. Fix remaining networking code compilation issues
3. Test full gameplay functionality
4. Address any runtime compatibility issues

## Impact
The migration provides:
- Modern Allegro 5 foundation for continued development
- Backward compatibility with existing Gravity Strike codebase
- Path forward for future enhancements and platform support
- Resolution of deprecated library dependencies
