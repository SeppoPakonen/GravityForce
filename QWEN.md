# Qwen Agent Work Tracking

This file documents the work being performed by the Qwen agent on the Gravity Strike project.

## Current Focus
The Qwen agent is currently investigating and resolving issues with the Gravity Strike game's data file loading system. The main problem identified is that the Allegro 5 wrapper has stubbed out data file functions that simply return nullptr instead of actually loading the data files.

## Completed Tasks
1. âœ… Fixed inverted conditional logic in main.cpp that caused program to "fall through" when initialization failed
2. âœ… Added verbose flag (-v) to help explain program internals
3. âœ… Built the project successfully with enhanced debugging
4. âœ… Ran the program with verbose flag to confirm functionality
5. âœ… Added more verbose messages throughout initialization process
6. âœ… Improved mouse initialization to handle remote/headless environments gracefully
7. âœ… Added detailed verbosity to data file loading to diagnose failures
8. âœ… Added -v2 extra verbose flag to dump loaded variables and data structures
9. âœ… Investigated how data files are generated and identified regeneration methods
10. âœ… Identified root cause: Allegro 5 wrapper has stubbed data file functions
11. âœ… Modified build.sh to enable direct asset loading by default
12. âœ… Updated allegro5_wrapper.cpp to log direct asset loading attempts

## In Progress
- ðŸ”§ Reverse engineering asset sources to recreate data files without using Allegro 4 data file system
- ðŸ”§ Implementing compile flag to use source-resource-files directly
- ðŸ”§ Creating asset loading functions that can load directly from individual files

## Planned Work
- Test incremental loading to prove the approach works
- Eventually figure out dat file recompilation for full compatibility

## Key Findings
The core issue is that `/home/sblo/GravityForce/src/allegro5_wrapper.cpp` contains stub implementations of critical data file functions:
```cpp
DATAFILE *load_datafile(const char *filename) {
    (void)filename;
    // Not implemented - need a real implementation based on Allegro 5 data system
    return nullptr;  // <-- This is why all data files fail to load!
}
```

The project contains all necessary source assets (images, sounds, fonts, configurations) but lacks proper data file loading implementation.

## Asset Discovery
We have identified all the required data files and their asset indexes:
1. **gsmenu.dat** - Menu assets (weapons, crosshairs, ships, title, palettes)
2. **gs.dat** - Game assets (likely maps, game objects, etc.)
3. **ships.dat** - Ship sprites and definitions
4. **fonts.dat** - Font files
5. **gssnd.dat** - Sound samples

The project also contains complete source assets:
1. Individual ship sprites in `ships/` directory
2. Level assets in `levels/` directories
3. Map files and configuration files

## Solution Path
We are implementing a compile flag approach to bypass the broken data file system:
1. Create `-DDIRECT_ASSET_LOADING` compile flag (âœ… COMPLETED)
2. Modify asset loading code to detect this flag (âœ… COMPLETED)
3. When enabled, load assets directly from individual files instead of datafiles
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

## Current Status
Direct asset loading is now enabled by default in the build system:
- Build.sh shows "Building Gravity Strike with direct asset loading enabled..."
- Compilation includes `-DDIRECT_ASSET_LOADING` flag
- Runtime shows enhanced debugging output indicating when direct asset loading is attempted
